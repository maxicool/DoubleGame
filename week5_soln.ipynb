    "By the end of this notebook you should:\n",

    "* Be able to find intersections of lines and conics in the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}^2$.\n",
    "* Be able to find the equation of a conic passing through a prescribed set of points. \n",

    "## Introduction to the theme\n",
    "\n",
    "This theme is about properties of (algebraic) plane curves of small degree.\n",
    "The only things you need to know are basics of linear algebra, how to solve simple polynomials equations and a smidgin of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably already familiar with lines and conics. These are the plane curves of degree $1$ and $2$, respectively.\n",
    "So the only new curves you are going to meet here are *cubic curves*.\n",
    "They are simply the curves in the plane that are given by polynomial equations of degree $3$.\n",
    "Cubic curves, also known as *elliptic curves*, play a very important role in Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, and Cryptography.\n",
    "One of the original seven Millennium Prize Problems set by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000 is about cubic curves;\n",
    "it is known as the *Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture* and the prize for its correct proof is $\\$1,000,000$!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn about geometry of plane curves is to play with them. To make this more enjoyable, we will use Python to do all boring computations for us.\n"
