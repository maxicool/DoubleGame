    "## End of theme assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your completed assessment should consist of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This completed Jupyter notebook, including all requested code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In-code comments** should be included to explain the steps of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A LaTeX document containing the requested explanations. You can use `RM_eot.tex` as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final document must be **no longer than three pages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each question, you should provide **explicit computations** for solving the problems. Whenever appropriate, you should also provide **theoretical justification** for your results, quoting lemmas, theorems, etc from the lectures, tutorial worksheets and/or references. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Latex document should showcase the **ideas** and **methodology** that go into solving the problems. For instance, some questions require repeating the same computations over and over again. In such cases, it may be desireable to describe a single example in the Latex document, rather than spelling out every single calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You can get a feel for what is required by considering the markdown text in the tutorial worksheets and solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Please upload **both** your final compiled PDF **and** your completed Jupyter notebook, via Learn.\n",

    "## Marking\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment is marked out of 15. Marks will be based on\n",
    "\n",
    "**10 marks** Completeness and correctness.\n",
    "- Questions should be answered fully and correctly.\n",
    "- The discussion should be complete, relevant, and correct.\n",
    "- You should correctly describe the methods used, and where appropriate relate the discussion to the theoretic background.\n",
    "- All code should be clear, correct, and appropriately commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5 marks** Presentation and use of LaTeX.\n",
    "- LaTeX should be used correctly and appropriately.\n",
    "- Text should be in grammatical sentences and free of typographical errors.\n",
    "- Any formulae should be appropriately typeset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed mark scheme is available on Learn.\n",

    "* `plt.savefig(\"figname.png\", dpi=250)`\n",
    "* `plt.savefig(\"figname.pdf\", dpi=250)`\n",

    "\n",
    "The data relevant to the assessment is stored in numpy array files called 'rm_eot_x.npy' (predictors) and 'rm_eot_y.npy' (responses). A description of the data is stored in the file 'README.txt'. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Question 1 - Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the data description in the 'README.txt' file. Plot the response against each of the variables `[Existence of a graduate employment programme at the school, Motivation of teaching staff, Grade average]`. Include appropriate titles, labels, and legends. Add the plots to your LaTeX write-up. In your LaTeX write-up describe the data, referencing your figures where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2 - Regression Analysis\n",
    "Two regression models are proposed:\n",
    "* A linear model: $y=\\beta_0+\\sum_j \\beta_jx_j$.\n",
    "* A logistic model: $y=g^{-1}\\left(\\beta_0+\\sum_j \\beta_jx_j\\right)$ with $g(p)=\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit both models to obtain estimates $\\hat\\beta_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ (for the linear model) and $\\hat\\beta_{\\mathrm{log}}$ (for the logistic model). If necessary, you may use the function IRLS in the file 'IRLS.py'. In your write-up, include the respective estimates, and describe how you calculated them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a plot with the data and the fitted values (for both models). Include appropriate titles, labels, and legends. Add the plots to your write-up, adding captions and references where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the root mean squared error for both models, and include these in your write-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3 - Model Comparison\n",
    "Add a brief discussion to your write-up arguing which model is preferable. Give both a qualitative and a quantitative reason.\n",
