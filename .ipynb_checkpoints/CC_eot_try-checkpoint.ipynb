    "Your completed assessment should consist of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This completed Jupyter notebook, including all requested code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In-code comments** should be included to explain the steps of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A LaTeX document containing the requested explanations. You can use `CC_eot.tex` as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final document must be **no longer than three pages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each question, you should provide **explicit computations** for solving the problems. Whenever appropriate, you should also provide **theoretical justification** for your results, quoting lemmas, theorems, etc from the lectures, tutorial worksheets and/or references. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Latex document should showcase the **ideas** and **methodology** that go into solving the problems. For instance, some questions require repeating the same computations over and over again. In such cases, it may be desireable to describe a single example in the Latex document, rather than spelling out every single calculation. \n",

    "**10 marks** Completeness and correctness.\n",
    "- Questions should be answered fully and correctly.\n",
    "- The discussion should be complete, relevant, and correct.\n",
    "- You should correctly describe the methods used, and where appropriate relate the discussion to the theoretic background.\n",
    "- All code should be clear, correct, and appropriately commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5 marks** Presentation and use of LaTeX.\n",
    "- LaTeX should be used correctly and appropriately.\n",
    "- Text should be in grammatical sentences and free of typographical errors.\n",
    "- Any formulae should be appropriately typeset."
